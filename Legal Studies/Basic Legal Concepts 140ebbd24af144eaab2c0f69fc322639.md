### **English Law Heritage**

- Priests used "Divine Judgement" to handle disputes
- Commenced with William of Normandy (1066 AD)
- After 1066 AD, William imposed "King's Law" across Britain

### **Norman Law**

- King's Law
- Humiliation to death

    - Justice bodies throughout the kingdom to apply "King's Law"
    - King can also hear claims and decide outcomes/issues between subjects
    - King can make decisions derived from "the Power of God"
        - Common law doesn't apply
        - Does whatever he wants

### **Sources of Law**

English law is an **adversarial system**, also known as a common law system.

- 2 parties or more confront each other with a claim/argument supported by evidence and presented to by an impartial judge
- Each party "tests evidence" to shows that their version of the truth is more correct

In a criminal case, the standard of proof is "beyond all reasonable doubt".

In a civil case (claim for money), the standard of proof is "balance of probabilities"

üí° Judges don‚Äôt make enquiries about questions of fact (i.e. What happened?)

</aside>

The Royal Commission operate according to civil law proceedings.

Judgement of higher courts are binding and must be followed by lower courts (*re decisis*).

- Old case laws can be relevant today
- If there are changes in societal values, common can change old case laws to create new precedent law

| Ration decendi | Legal reason of the decision |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Judges MUST resolve disputes by considering previous precedents (stare decisis) | Appeal for a case to be reviewed in the High Court | Precedent created in another jurisdiction of a court in the hierarchy | The power to hear disputes for the first time from questions of fact and law |

| Lower court judges cannot change the precedent |  | Can be instructive to judge |  |
| Judgement is open to appeal to a higher court |  | Higher court‚Äôs decision overwrites any lower court‚Äôs decision |  |

## **Coroner's Court**

- Inquisitorial model for inquiring into unexplained events/deaths (Tribunal of Fact)
- Council assisting the Coroner and Coroner themselves will ask questions to the witness
- Coroner makes findings about the event/incident such as:
    - Persons of interest
    - Recommendations to police
    - Director of Public Prosecutions

## **Courts and "Original Jurisdiction"**

- A jury decides questions of fact (what happened) and the judges decide on questions of law (punishment with equity)
- In Appellate (Appeals) Courts, **judges decide issues of questions of law, not fact's/merits** of the case
- Some cases allow the agreement of prosecution in criminal cases - an appeal with questions of fact (new/existing evidence)
- There is no criminal jurisdiction in Federal Court:
    - Prosecution of Federal crimes occur in State and Territory, District and Supreme Courts

## **Creating Acts of Parliament**

1. Bill (draft Act) is bought into the Upper (Senate)/Lower (House of Representatives) House by a political member of the House
2. First Reading - announces the title of the Bill
3. Member/Minister provides a statement in the House about the terms of the Bill
4. Second Reading - Debate about the Bill
5. "Select Committee" recommends amendments if any
6. If the Bill goes to 3rd Reading, then majority wins
7. The Bill then proceeds to the next House, steps 1-6 repeated, Bill has passed
8. Finally, Bill goes to Governor-General for Royal Assent, THEN it becomes an Act

| Delegated Legislation | Laws made by authorities other than parliament |
