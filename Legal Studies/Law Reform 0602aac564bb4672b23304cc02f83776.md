## Conditions giving rise to law reform

| Law Reform |
| --- |
| The parliamentary or judicial amendment of law to address specific legal rights and responsibilities |
| Reforms can be progressive or regressive |

### Conditions for Law Reform

- Failure of existing laws
    - Disconnect with change
- New concepts of justice
    - Old legal principles no longer apply
- Changes in technology
- Demands for security
    - Security of person and state

For the rights of the individual, law reforms must consider individualism and collectivism.

The journey of legitimacy of same-sex marriage comes from its illegitimacy:

- Defacto relationship
    - 2 years of cohabitation
    - Genuine domestic relationship
    - Gives rise to property entitlement rights
        - Economic entitlement to be divided pro-rata (as a % contributor)
            - No future needs entitlement

### Defacto Relationship 1984 (NSW)

- Recognised same-sex relationships before the law
- Amended as **Property (Relationships) Act 1984**
    - Creates rights and responsibilities relying on dependence and interdependence
- 25 other laws were addressed under the **Property (Relationship) Amendment Act 1999 NSW**
- In 2006, the **Successor Act NSW** was amended to recognise same-sex relationships
- In 2010, **Family Law amendment** and **Financial Measures Act 2008 (Commonwealth)** came into effect
- In 2017, **Marriage Amendment Act 2017** finally recognised same-sex marriage

## Law Reform and Technology

Legal and non-legal measures that address technological changes in society are deemed as **reactionary**.

The occurrence of law reform to technology arises when a large portion of the community, economy and the vulnerable are affected (i.e. Online engagement is ubiquitous).

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Declaration of "Terra nullius" (land belonging to no one) and application of English Law | Protectionism under state law; chief protectors determining life choices of Indigenous | Wave Hill walk-off/strike led by Vincent Lingiari (head stockman for the Gurindji people seeking land rights for a postal company) | Uluru and "Statement from hear" (Constitutional recognition of First Nations People) |

| "100 years unfinished business” | 1952 - Electoral Act 1962 gave Aboriginal males the
right to vote in Federal elections | 1970 - Nabalco case against a mining lease to mine bauxite. Milippum v Nabalco 1970 (FLR) was lost because Terra Nullius applies, therefore no claim |  |

| --- | --- |

### Mabo v Queensland (2) 1992 HCA

- Doctrine of Terra nullius was a legal fiction in relation to Australia
- The denial of legal recognition of Indigenous land entitlement to common land entitlement was false
- Common Law Native Title applied
- Native title could be demonstrated by a continuing connection to land and customary law
- Freehold law extinguished Native Title **but not in relation to Crown Land in all states**

### Native Title Act 1993 (Commonwealth)

- Establishes Native Title
    - Conditions to be met to demonstrate
    - Creates the Native Title Tribunal

### Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria 2002 HCA

| Issue | Yorta claimed it wrong to expect continuous observance of customary law in relation to land |
| --- | --- |
| Held | Traditions and customs need to be demonstrated to show observance. Claimants had to prove an acknowledgement and observance over "substantially uninterrupted time". Oral transmissions of actions and laws is not sufficient. However, evident customs and traditions that may influence their way of life is sufficient |

### Wik People vs Queensland 1996 HCA

| Issue | Could Native Title co-exist with Crown lease? |
| --- | --- |
| Held | Native Title could co-exist with pastoral and mining leases |
- Resulted with the **Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (Commonwealth)**
    - John Howard's 10 point plan
        - Land that was used by companies for primary use had no Native Title rights
        - Government could solely interpret what "exclusive" meant in exclusive Native Title
        - Government could disregard Native Title if it hindered their ability to provide services
        - Government could disregard Native Title for future mining activities

## Law Reform on Sexual Assault Crimes

- Data/statistics on law reporting; reason for not reporting
- Types of offences i.e. **SA s. 61 Crimes Act 1900 NSW**

- The nature of consent before 2021 was "affirmative consent"
- **Affirmative Consent Act** provided a prescriptive definition of "consent" but not restrictive as to what doesn't constitute consent
- Examined the creation of the offence of **"sexual assault in company" s. 61 JA Crimes Act** arising from **R v Skaf 2002 NSWDC** and directly from **R v AEM, KEM, MM (2002) NSWCCA**

- In general, a **Bill of Rights** may be connected/linked to a constitution of a nation-state
- The rights may be reflected on a historical point in time
    - Will not be easily amended to reflect issues that may need reform
- Therefore, it is inflexible and open to judicial interpretation
- *i.e. **USA Bill of Rights (Constitutional Amendments)***

---

- Indivisible
    - Unable to be split up
- Inalienable
    - Unable to be interpreted
- Inherent
    - Applies to every human
- Universal

- Land rights in the 1960's in Australia was part of the development of Indigenous **self-determination**
- NOTE: i.e.
    - **1966**
        - The **Wave Hill Walk-off** attempted self-determination
    - **1970**
        - **Milippum v Nabalco Ltd 1970 FCA (Nabalco Case)** reaffirming Terra Nullius
    - **1992**
        - **Mabo v Queensland (2) 1992 HCA** was central to Indigenous self-determination because it recognised the existence and continuity of Indigenous customary law
    - **2017**
        - Uluru statement of "The Heart" is another mechanism for self-determination
            - Recognition of an Indigenous person

| Circle sentencing |

| Sentencing mechanism only reserved for Indigenous people for summary offences |
| The magistrate and Elders sit in a circle and talk through the issue and come to a suitable sentence |
| Essentially, it is a community-based punishment process |
