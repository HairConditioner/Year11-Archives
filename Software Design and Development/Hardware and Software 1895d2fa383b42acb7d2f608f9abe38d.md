## Elements of a Computer System

- Elements of a computer system include:
    - **Hardware**
    - **Software**
    - **Data**
    - **Personnel**
    - **Procedures**

- Input devices include:
    - **Keyboard**
    - **Mouse**
    - **Microphone**
- The keyboard and mouse are most likely to be connected to a computer using **USB**
- **Storage** maintains data even when the system is off
- Microphones **convert sound waves into digital samples**
- To capture analog data for processing with a computer requires **ADC**
- **Active RFID** allows identification data to be captured from distances in excess of 50m
- CCDs are commonly found in devices which capture **images**
- **Barcode readers** often send data to the computer in a format that mimics the data sent by a keyboard
- The data produced by a keyboard when a key is pressed and released is **ASCII code**
- A sound card is used for **output only**
- **Color printers** use the CMYK system
- Piezo crystal are used in **inkjet printers**
- Substances in a state between liquid and solid are known as **plasmas**
- Within an LCD screen, **polarizing panels** ensure that light can only exit at right angles to the light entering the screen
- Within plasma screens, visible light is generated by **phosphors**
- A refresh rate of 50Hz means **the screen is redrawn 50 times each second**
- **HDMI** is able to transmit video, audio and control data
- Plasma emits **UV light**
- Within a laser printer, a **fuser** makes the image permanent

### Operation of a Keyboard

- When a key is pressed, it closes a switch, completing and electrical circuit to allow current to flow through to the processor

- The vibration of the key produces ‚Äúbounce‚Äù, which is filtered out by the processor

### RFID vs Barcode Scanners

| RFID | Barcode |
| --- | --- |
| Uses radio signals to scan items | Requires a line of sight |
| Can read multiple codes at once | Can only scan each code individually |

---

## Processing and Control

- Another term for main memory is **primary storage**
- Processing and control functions are performed by **transistors**

| Bus Interface | Provides communication between CPU and RAM |
| --- | --- |
| Static RAM Chip | Able to hold a binary state without the need for recharging |
| Processing | Transforms input to output |
| Secondary Storage | Storage that remains when the power is turned off |
| Registers | Memory areas that are used to store instructions currently being used by the CPU |
| Floating Point | Performs all non-integer numeric calculations |
| Accumulator | A register within the CPU that holds the result of the last operation performed by the ALU |

---

## Software

| Multi-tasking | Ability to execute more than one program at a time |
| --- | --- |
| Operating System | Controls hardware and software |
| COTS Based Packages | Developing smaller applications with limited users |
| Application Software | i.e. Spreadsheet and Database Software |
| Application Interface | Provides the means for application software to communicate with the operating system |
| Driver | Medium for device to communicate with the operating system |
| Off-the-shelf | Application software that is pre-packaged |

### System vs Application Software

| System Software | Operating System software that manages and controls the resources of the system |
| --- | --- |
| Application Software | Software designed to perform a specific task for the user |

## Programming Languages

- Provides a more human way of instructing computers

### Generations of Programming Languages

- Low-level languages include:
    - First generation machine languages
        - Each instruction is represented by a series of binary digits
    - Second generation assembler languages
        - Was the first attempt in making programming languages more human-like
        - Used mnemonics to represent different commands

<aside>
üí° First and second generation languages are known as low-level languages because their instructions directly access the CPU

</aside>

- High-level languages include:
    - Third generation languages
        - Simplify the programming process
        - Allow programmers to focus on solving problems rather than dealing with mundane system details
        - There are many types of high-level languages to solve many types of problems:
            - **Python, R and Scala** - Data science and deep learning
            - **Kotlin, Swift, Objective C** - Mobile app development
            - **JavaScript, Typescript, Ruby** - Web data processing and development
            - **C++, C#** - Desktop game development
            - **Java** - Back-end web development and data manipulation

<aside>
üí° Third and subsequent languages have a much more human-legible syntax and translate into machine instructions

</aside>

- Declarative languages include:
    - Fourth generation languages
        - Similar to spreadsheets or database queries
        - Describe a sequence of processes leading to the solution of the problem
        - Developer is required to know how to solve the problem before writing the program
        - Programs written in declarative languages are more of a formal description or specification of the problem

### Event Driven vs Sequential Approach

| Event Driven | Sequential |
| --- | --- |
| Listen to and respond the certain occurrences and events | Have a distinct start and end |
| Has the ability to execute specific sections of code | Instructions are executed after one another |

---

## The Need for Translation

| Lexical analysis | Examines each element of the source code to ensure that it is a legitimate part of the high-level programming language |
| --- | --- |
| Syntactical analysis | Checks if the grammar or syntax of the source code is correct |

### Compilation

- Translating the entire source code into object code
- Object code is then combined with other linked files to create the final executable files
- No translation required at runtime

### Interpretation

- After each statement has been translated into machine code it is immediately executed
- This process continues until it encounters an error
- Requires significant processing resources which can result in the program having poor performance
