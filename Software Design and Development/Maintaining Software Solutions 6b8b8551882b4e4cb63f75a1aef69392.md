## Reasons for Maintaining Code

### Changing User Requirements

- Include new functions due to changes in users’ requirements
- Minor modifications or enhancement of existing functions

### Upgrading User Interface

- Major changes in the UI can cause problems for users skilled in the previous version
- Care must be taken to ensure consistency between subsequent versions

### Changes in the Data to be Processed

- Modifications to software are often required when the structure or format of a data field changes
- *i.e. widespread use of mobile phones mean that most applications require storing of mobile phone numbers*

| Maintainability | A measure of ease with which source code can be modified and understood |
| --- | --- |
| Backward Compatible | The ability of a new system to operate in harmony with an older system |
- Software solutions may be required to be modified because:
    - Users have new and different requirements
    - Changes have been made in the organization that need to be reflected in the software solution
    - Changes have been made to government legislation that need reflecting in the software

| User Interface | Medium that enables users to communicate with the software |

- Changes made to the structure/format of input data will most likely result in **the need for the software to be modified accordingly**
- The operation of software may be alternated by the introduction of:
    - New CPU’s
    - Different storage devices
    - Different peripherals
- Maintenance of software solutions is necessary to:
    - Correct known bugs
    - Add additional requested functionality

- Non-standard control structures should **never be used at all**
