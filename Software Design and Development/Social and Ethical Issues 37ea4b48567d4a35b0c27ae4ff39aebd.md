## Evolutions of Software Application

- Gopher servers contained **text based documents**
- Software that locates, accesses and displays web pages is known as **a web browser**
- The company that refined many of the design concepts that form the basis of today’s Graphical User Interface was **Xerox**
- Facebook is an example of a **Social networking application**
- Relative and absolute referencing is a concept that is present in **spreadsheet software**
- The first widely available browser was **Mosaic**
- VisiCalc was developed by **Bricklin and Frankston**
- The computer that was widely recognized as the first to include a fully bit-mapped display is the **Alto**
- Archie was an early example of a **search engine**

### Command-line interfaces (CLI) vs Graphical user interfaces (GUI)

| Command-line interfaces | Graphical user interfaces |
| --- | --- |
| Text-based | Graphic and front-end oriented |
| Communicated to the user via prompts | Communicated to the user via screen elements/widgets |
| User must have extensive knowledge of commands | User is not required to have any knowledge of the back-end |
| Preferred for performing automated tasks | Preferred for performing day-to-day tasks |

## Intellectual Property

- In terms of software licenses, the term non-exclusive means **the product can be licensed to multiple users**
- Property that results from the fruits of mental effort is known as **intellectual property**
- Software that is NOT covered by copyright is considered to be **public domain software**
- A software product that where code is developed collaboratively and is freely available to all is likely covered by an **open source license**
- A commercial software license usually gives the user **the right to distribute the software**
- The process of decompiling is used when **reverse engineering**
- With regard to computer software licenses, the term *program* means **executable files and included data files only**
- For copyright laws NOT to apply, the developer must **expressly state that the product is in the public domain**

### Intellectual Property vs License Agreements vs Copyright Laws

| Intellectual Property | License Agreements | Copyright Laws |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Property resulting from fruits of mental labor | A grant of permission | Protects the intellectual property rights of software developers |
|  |  | A legally binding license agreement (depends on country) |

### Warranty vs Liability

| Warranty | Liability |
| --- | --- |
| An guarantee that a product may work | An obligation or debt as a result of some event |
|  | License agreements normally reduce the liability of the software developer in refunding/replacing |

### Software Intellectual Property Rights

- Software intellectual property rights is special because software can be easily copied and uncredited which resulted in the application of licenses
- However, to enforced these licenses are too time consuming and costly, which lead to the creation of open source and creative commons licenses

### License Agreements

| Commercial | Shareware | Freeware | Public Domain | Open Source | Creative Commons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Covered by copyright | Covered by copyright | Covered by copyright | Not covered by copyright | Not covered by copyright | Not covered by copyright |
| One archival copy can be made as backup | Many copies can be made for archive or distribution | Many copies can be made, distributed and altered | Many copies can be made, distributed and altered | Many copies can be made, distributed and altered | Many copies can be made, distributed and altered |
| Cannot be reverse engineered | Cannot be reverse engineered | Can be reverse engineered | Source code is public | Source code is public | Source code is public |
| Source code is not distributed | Source code is not distributed | Source code is not distributed | Source code is developed collaboratively and available to be distributed | Source code is available to be distributed | Source code is available to be distributed |

## Social Context of Software Design

- From a user interface perspective, the most important aspect is **consistency**
- A programmer would use progress bars as a means of **providing feedback to the user**
- The primary method that an application uses to communicate problems to users is **messages**
- Users are likely to feel that the computer has taken control when response times exceed **0.1 seconds**
- Command buttons, check boxes and radio buttons can be best described as **screen elements**
- A programmer could use **tabbed dialogues** to ensure data is validated
- If a software application is intuitive, consistent and easy to learn, then it could be considered to be **user friendly**
- The percentage of white space appearing on a well-designed screen should be about **50%**

### Functionality vs User-friendliness

Programs with great functionality may not be commercially successful because it doesn’t meet the user’s standards. Specifically, it may not have a good ratio of white space (50%) or may have response times that exceed 0.1 seconds.

### User Interface Consistency

- **Setting standards**
    - Set design standards based on industry standards and then developed extra standards specific to application
- **Use screen elements appropriately**
    - Screen elements should perform the expected functions
- **Use color appropriately**
    - Use color sparingly because different users have different standards
    - Don’t override operating system settings - ensures consistency between applications
    - Sufficient contrast between text and background
- **Use fonts appropriately**
    - Use of fancy fonts can decrease readability
    - Don’t override operating system settings - ensures consistency between applications

- **Aligning of input elements**
    - Text boxes should be left justified with associated labels
    - Columns of data should be right justified with labels left justified
