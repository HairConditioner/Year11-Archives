## Set 3A

| Prototype | Reenactable model of a software system |
| --- | --- |
| Implementing the Solution | Coding the prototype in a programming language |
- For a prototyping approach to be successful, **strong communication between the developers and the users** are needed
- Keeping accurate documentation in **the structured approach** is especially important
- A **structured approach** is characterized by distinct stages
- Pseudocode is an example of an **algorithm description language**
- In the structure approach, the stage of **defining and understanding the problem** has the relative timing allocated to each step of the project
- A **prototyping approach** produces a series of operational versions of the product

## Set 3B

| RAD Approach | Unstructured, informal development with no documentation |
| --- | --- |
| Rapid Prototyping | A combination of RAD and Prototyping approaches |
|  |  |
- The style of development undertaken by the end user approach may be considered to be **informal**
- The RAD approach aims to **reduce both development time and cost**
- **Prototyping** delivers working versions of software after each iteration
- **RAD approach** encourages the use of existing code and already developed modules
- The use of CASE tools is unlikely when using **the structured approach**

| Post-test Iteration (Unguarded Loop) | A repetition control structure where the terminating condition is checked after the body of the loop |
| --- | --- |
| Pre-test Iteration (Guarded Loop) | A repetition control structure where the terminating condition is checked before the body of loop |
