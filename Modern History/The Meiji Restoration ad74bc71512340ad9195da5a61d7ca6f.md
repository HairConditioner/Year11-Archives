## Was the Meiji Restoration a Modern Revolution?

| Revolution | An overthrow of a government or ideology in favour of another |

| Pros (A Modern History of Japan from Tokugawa Times to the Present - Andrew Gordon) | Cons (The Meiji Restoration - WG Beasley) |
| --- | --- |
| The reforms for the following decades were thoroughly transformative for Japan | Did not reorganise society to the extent of the French and Russian revolutions |
| Characteristics such as the abolition of feudalism and hereditary privileges were all similar to European bourgeois revolutions | Was done by the emperor rather than the people |
| Government had become merit-based and electoral for opportunities for ordinary people to influence the political process | It was forced from the outside by Western imperialism rather than the desire to improve the rights and freedoms of ordinary people |
| Technological changes that swept Japan were equivalent to the Industrial Revolution in  Europe | The Japanese saw it as a “restoration” rather than a revolution - suggesting that the era was seen more as building upon rather than a rejection of the past |
| Large-scale capitalism |  |
